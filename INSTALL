Nothing needs to be done if you just want to use the R Scripts--simply
load the R package before you call any of the Scripts.

If you want to change the C files and then update the R package you
need to go to <Code/BLPackage> and change <sync.bash> so that the
variable BASE points to the directory in which this file is located.
You also need to get the Matrix and RNG code.  Go to <Code/C/include>
(you might have to create the <include> directory) and do

git clone https://github.com/jwindle/Matrix.git
git clone https://github.com/jwindle/RNG.git

You also need to install Eigen and then tell the Makefile where it is.
The easyiest thing to do would be to put Eigen in the <include>
directory as well, then you do not need to change anything.

To do that: download Eigen:
<http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>.  After
unzipping, copy the enclosed <Eigen> directory to <include>.
