To generate the C library manually.

1) Get the BayesLogit code.
 
  - You can clone the repository or download the code as a zip file via
    github.com.

  - For these instructions, ASSUME the repository directory is called
    BayesLogit.

2) Install the Matrix and RNG files in BayesLogit/Code/C/include/

  - From the command line
      - cd to BayesLogit/Code/C/include	
      $ wget https://github.com/jwindle/Matrix/archive/master.zip
      $ wget https://github.com/jwindle/RNG/archive/master.zip
  
  - Or from your browser
    - type in the above links and save them in
      BayesLogit/Code/C/include/

  - Unzip the files.

  - Remove the -master suffix 
    $ mv Matrix-master Matrix
    $ mv RNG-master RNG

3) Compile 

  - cd to BayesLogit/Code/C
  $ make BayesLogit.so

To generate the R package.

1) Follow steps (1) and (2) above.

2) cd to BayesLogit/Code/BLPackage

3) Update the files for the package.

  $ bash sync.bash

4) Build the package

  $ R CMD build BayesLogit

5) Check the package (optional)

  $ R CMD check BayesLogit_WHATEVER.tar.gz 

6) Install the package

  $ R CMD INSTALL BayesLogit_WHATEVER.tar.gz

Nothing needs to be done if you just want to use the R Scripts--simply
load the R package before you call any of the Scripts.

If you want to change the C files and then update the R package you
need to go to <Code/BLPackage> and change <sync.bash> so that the
variable BASE points to the directory in which this file is located.

You also need to get the Matrix and RNG classes.  Download
https://github.com/jwindle/Matrix/archive/master.zip
https://github.com/jwindle/RNG/archive/master.zip
to the <Code/C/include> directory and unzip them.

You also need to install Eigen and then tell the Makefile where it is.
The easyiest thing to do would be to put Eigen in the <include>
directory as well, then you do not need to change anything.

To do that: download Eigen:
<http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>.  After
unzipping, copy the enclosed <Eigen> directory to <include>.
