Dynamic logistic and dynamic negative binomial benchmarks...

Key:

$ denotes the command line
> denotes the R prompt

* Make sure you have the following R packages:

  RcppEigen
  coda

* Open a terminal and navigate to the directory in which this file is located.

* Install the package (1):

** On Linux or on Mac (with requisite tools, e.g. g++, gfortran, etc.)

  $ R CMD INSTALL BayesLogit_0.2-4-dynamic.tar.gz

** On Mac (x86)

  Manually install using .tgz file.

** On Windows

  No support currently.

* Set a low number of samples for a test run.

  $ bash SetSize.bash small

* Open up R, and make this directory the working directory.

* Initialize the library:

  > library("BayesLogit")

* Run either

  > source("Benchmark-DynLogit.R")

or

  > source("Benchmark-DynNB.R")

* After you have ran these scripts there will a list called "tables", which is a
list of the tables and a list called "ids", which is a list of the different
benchmarks.  Thus, run

  > ids
  > tables

  or

  > for (i in 1:length(ids)) { print(ids[[i]]); print(tables[[i]]); }

* Quit R and set a high nubmer of samples to check the paper.

  $ bash SetSize.bash large

* Rerun the R scripts and check the new tables.

(1) You need to be able to manually install R packages.

If you do not have administrator priveleges for your machine then you will need
to proceed in a slightly diffrent fashion.  In particular, 

* Install the package locally

  $ mkdir Packages
  $ R CMD INSTALL -l Packages BayesLogit_0.2-4-dynamic.tar.gz 

* Load the library (assuming you are within this directory)

  > library("BayesLogit", lib.loc="Packages")
