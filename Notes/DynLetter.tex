\begin{letter}{Bayesian Analysis}
\opening{Dear Editors:}
 
\npoint We hereby submit for your consideration a paper proposing a posterior
simulation technique for dynamic generalized linear models whose observations
have binomial likelihoods.
%
\npoint The method is useful when modeling temporally correlated counts or
binary outcomes, as might arise in ecology, epidemiology, neuroscience,
economics, or medicine.
% 
\npoint Posterior simulation in such scenarios is difficult since (1) non-normal
responses break the forward filter backwards sampler, a method that is linear in
the number of outcomes, and (2) time series are inherently high-dimensional,
making Metropolis-Hastings based approaches a challenge.
% 
\npoint We propose a data augmentation strategy and compare it to two preeminent
alternatives, one that uses data augmentation and another that uses
Metropols-Hastings.
%
\npoint The subsequent benchmarks show that our method performs well for dynamic
logistic regression and dynamic negative binomial regression for small count
sizes.
% 
\npoint The supplementary file submitted will let anyone with the ability to
compile an R package perform the same set of benchmarks.
